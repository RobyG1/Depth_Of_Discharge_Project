These programs were written in conjunction with the publication ''Roby Gauthier et al. 2022 J. Electrochem. Soc. 169 020518'',

Program #1 allows us to calculate the slippages and active mass loss of each electrode by fitting dV/dQ data from cycling. 

Marc Cormier and John Corsten wrote the next generation of program #1, which can be found at https://github.com/mmemcormier/divan.

Program #2 calculates the full cell voltage curve from half-cell data for different active masses and slippages.

Program #3 allows to get the constant voltage (CV) capacity gain from the CV step from constant current/constant voltage (CCCV) charge and CC discharge cycling data.

Program #4 calculates the effect of depth of discharge on capacity loss.
